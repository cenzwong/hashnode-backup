## Past Blogging Platform

Hi everyone!!! I am thrilled to find this page. Such a easy to use blogging webpage.

I have archived the old blog post to the following website

1. https://cmakerhk.wordpress.com/
2. https://cenzblog.github.io/
3. https://cenz.hashnode.dev/ - currently using

Let me briefly summarize the different between three approach. The first one is built using WordPress online. I spent lots of time on the formatting and it is not programmer friendly, like code snippet or markdown support.

Next, I built the static website using  [Hexo](https://hexo.io/zh-tw/) with github. It is more flexible and programmer friendly, but it is too flexible that i have to take care more node.js thing and still it is not fast for me to update the blog post.

I tried using github.io and put those blog with github repository. It works very well except that It is not managed. More I tried using  [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) which is the best editing tools but it is not public for all of you :-)

Hashnode is so far the best solution of all kind. Haha. Glad that I found this platform.
