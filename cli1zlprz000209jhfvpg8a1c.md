[Microsoft Fabric](https://microsoft.com/microsoft-fabric) is a new data and analytics platform that aims to simplify and unify the modern data stack for the era of AI. It integrates various Microsoft technologies, such as **Azure Data Factory (Data Factory)**, **Azure Synapse Analytics (Synapse Data Engineering, Synapse Data Science, Synapse Data Warehouse, Synapse Real Time Analytics)**, **Power BI**, and **Azure OpenAI Service (Copilot)**, into a single product that provides end-to-end capabilities for data integration, engineering, warehousing, science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence. Microsoft Fabric also **leverages a single data lake called OneLake** that can store and access data from **any source**, including other cloud platforms like **Amazon S3**. OneLake can mount natively on File Explorer. Uploading a file to OneLake is just simply drag and drop. Microsoft Fabric was launched on May 23, 2023 \[[Launch Events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o_QDFq6gzE)\] and it offers a unified experience, architecture, governance, and business model for both IT and business users who want to unlock the potential of their data and create AI-powered solutions.

Here is the introduction video from Microsoft:

Microsoft Fabric brings Azure Data Services, such as Data Lake, SQL Analytics, and Notebook Environment, directly into the same environment as Microsoft 365. This means you can easily access and integrate Microsoft 365's Table (Microsoft Lists) and Files (SharePoint and OneDrive) with Power Platform to build non-time critical applications for different business users. No more excuses for not migrating to the cloud because the cloud has already come to you.

Microsoft Fabric is not just a new product. It is a new paradigm. It is a new way of thinking about data and analytics in the era of AI. It is a new way of empowering IT and business users to create solutions that enhance their productivity and collaboration. It is a new way of harnessing the power of Microsoft technologies, such as Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse Analytics, Power BI, and Azure OpenAI Service, in a single platform that integrates seamlessly with Microsoft 365. It is a new way of bringing the cloud to you, instead of you going to the cloud. Microsoft Fabric is the beast that awakens, and it is ready to transform your data and analytics journey. Are you ready to join the revolution?
